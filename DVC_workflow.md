# Effect of DVC on Workflows

To ensure accuracy in projects, data scientists frequently spend weeks and months on time-consuming experimentation. They perform the tedious task of configuring which model to train with what dataset. DVC impacts this process in the following ways:

- Comparing models can be costly if models are not finalized during training. DVC can help to manage the complexity of ML pipelines so that you can train the same model again and again.

- In training a large number of models, it is difficult for teams to remember or keep track of which model was trained with which type of data. DVC helps teams to maintain version files and to easily reference ML models and their results.

- In ML, as data is accessed by a massive audience, it can cause confusion among team members if datasets are not properly labelled following proper conventions. DVC, however, facilitates proper labeling to enable broader experimentation.

- DVC helps teams answer questions like “How was X model built?” as it offers reproducibility and the ability to share results between projects

- DVC's distributed nature allows users to work on desktops with GPUs, on laptops, and on cloud resources in the event that they need more memory.

- DVC aims to exclude the need for spreadsheets, tools, and ad hoc scripts to share documents for communication. Working on ML projects requires you to run a bunch of experiments and communicate their output with your colleagues, which becomes hectic when you forget to track what you did yesterday or a week ago.
